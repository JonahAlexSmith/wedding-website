If you're reading this - hello! I didn't want to spend money on Squarespace/Wix/etc to make a website for my wedding guests, so here it is deployed on GitHub Pages.

I am marrying a woman called called Erin.

This website is a fork of Hugo and Sarah's [wedding website](https://github.com/SarahFrench/wedding-website).
