Please wear what you would make you feel your most glamorous and sexy! We have no rules whatsoever and none of us will be wearing any traditional wedding fare - Hugo will be in a pink suit, and Sarah in a light green dress.

As we will be getting married on a farm in February we encourage everyone to bring lots of layers as there will be moments when we will need to go outside while barns are being rearranged.
