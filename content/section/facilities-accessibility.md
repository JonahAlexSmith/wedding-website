## Toilet access

There are 2 cubicle toilets (and a separate cubicle urinal) in the Banquet barn.

## Young children

We will make an area in the on-site accommodation available for any baby-changing, feeding or other needs. This will allow privacy and a space in case the baby and parents want time away from crowds.

## Reduced mobility

The two toilets in the Banquet barn can be used by ambulatory wheelchair users but may need to navigate a step to get there.

There are steps in all the barns. The Banquet barn has single, shallow steps at the entrance and between the main space and the bar area. The Chapel barn has four steps leading from the entrance to the main area, with no hand rails. The Chapel Barn has a barn door that can be opened to allow easier access if required.
